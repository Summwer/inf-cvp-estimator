This is the experiment of the article `Heuristic Algorithm for Solving Restricted SVP and its Applications` in PQC 2024.


`acvp_kannan_embedding_test.py` is an implementation of the Kannan embeding test for solving Approximate CVP problem, it should be implemented in the main directory of the G6K or G6K-GPU library.

`inf_cvp_estimator.sage` is the estimation file for estimating acvp instance by agps gate.
